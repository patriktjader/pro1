    <h1><b>My gaming progression</b></h1>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Gaming has been apart of my life ever since i went to the library in my grandpa's village for the first time while there visiting,<br>
    and some dirtbag teenagers had brought cs1.5 with them and were 2v2ing to see who was the best, ofcourse me and my brother were instantly intrigued.<br>
    We watched them play for hours, captivated by the fast-paced action and ofcourse we pesterd them to let us play. It was a whole new world for us, and we wanted to be a part of it.</p>

    <h2>Early Years</h2>
     <p>Since that first adrenaline rush back at my grandpa's village, my gaming journey has evolved significantly.<br>
        My first hurdle was to trick my parents to let us play those "violent" games but thrue sheer willpower and preseverance we managed to convince them.<br>
        I started out with counterstrike 1.6 and later moved on to cs source, but then cirka 2006 i started to overhear my older brothers friends talking about a game.
        ofcourse since i was the younger brother i wanted to know what they were talking about in came what would turn out to be my biggest obsession and my most beloved game.<br>
