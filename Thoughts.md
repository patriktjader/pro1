                                my first webpage

This was my first time dabbeling with "html/css/js" and it was very fun messing around and figuring stuff out, as you whomever is reading this can see alot of stuff is over the top with shadows glowing fonts hovering buttons etc etc, its all in good fun and has been a blast learning how to do.

My biggest struggles in this project was getting the youtube video lined up side by side with the text block, how ever i did they either shot to much apart or completley stuck together, how i solved this was saying enough is enough i cant find what im doing wrong so i removed all containers and redid all of them and somehow somwhere it fixed the problem.

another struggle was lining the music up so it started exactly when the reveal of hitting the button on the "my bio" page since the only music i found started 2 seconds into the clip and starting the music at the same time as hitting the button made the music lag 2 seconds behind, and the best audio version was on soundcloud so starting the clip at 2 seconds was not possible ("to my knowledge") so my first aha thought was "lets just put a 2 second timeout js function to the button", having never dabbled in js i had some figuering out to do, then when i figured out the timeout function i realized very quickly how having a button just take 2 seconds to do something was not ideal, in came the idea of glowpulse and making the button pulse and charge so atleast something happend and it worked out amazing as a tension builder aswell.

                                                          "final thoughts"

As my first "big" project all by myself this was extremly fun and a very good learning experience, i cant wait for my next project.
